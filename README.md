# jofroops-arraylist-modifier
Uses a variety of methods and recursive operations to modify an arraylist. Hope you like it!

So far, the program contains 5 operations that you can do. These are:
* Call a single entry
* Create a new entry
* Call all of the entries
* Delete a single entry
* Delete all entries

This program is very simple and while I don't plan on adding more features, I might. If I'm really bored.
